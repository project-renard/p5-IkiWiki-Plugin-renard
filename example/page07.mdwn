- Relative direction
    - Relative to the midline of the body
        - Medial: towards the midline
        - Lateral: away from the midline
        - usage: X is medial to Y (relative)
    - Relative to the origin of a body part (e.g., attachment of a limb to the trunk)
        - Proximal: closer to origin
        - Distal: further from origin
        - usage: e.g., Aorta origin is at heart so the aorta in the thoracic cavity is proximal
          relative to the distal aorta in the abdomen.
